Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.

**Retention Period**

We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

- The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);
- Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them);
- Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations). 

**Third Party Services**

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which the Services link.  The inclusion of a link on the website does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us.

In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Business Customers, Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer.

**Use of Services by minors**

The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 18.

**Jurisdiction and Cross-border transfer**

Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Services or otherwise interacting with us you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.

Unless we request it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us.

**Third party payment service**

The developer website may provide functionality allowing you to make payments to the Company using third-party payment services with which you have created your own account.  When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your Personal Information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information.

**End-User**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to our processing of Personal Information of end-users of our Business Customers’ products or services (“End-User”). If you are an End-User of one of our Business Customers, we will only process your Personal Information on behalf of our Business Customer where required to provide our Services (e.g., to facilitate a transaction). The Business Customer is responsible for the processing of your Personal Information and we act as a service provider in this context. This means that we will only process your Personal Information based on our Business Customer’s instructions.

Please consult the relevant Business Customer’s privacy policy for information about how they process your Personal Information. If you have questions or want to exercise rights in relation to your Personal Information, please contact the relevant Business Customer.
